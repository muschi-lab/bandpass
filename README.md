The bpass() function filters a time series signal, keeping only frequency components within a specified range (between period_high and period_low). Itâ€™s particularly useful in time series analysis where you want to isolate oscillations or signals within a specific band of frequencies. It was designed for computationally intensive Monte Carlo algorithms that require fast sequential bandpass filtering.

The function computes a bandpass filter for a timeseries 'signal' with timescale 'time', after removing the signal's mean. The 'period_low' and 'period_high' arguments define the longest and shortest period to retain, respectively. The user can adopt one out of three types of tapering window 'win': "gaussian", "cosine" or "none". Note that the method assumes that the data are evenly sampled.
