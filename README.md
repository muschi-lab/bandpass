This function computes a bandpass filter for a given timeseries 'signal' with timescale 'time' using the Fast Fourier Transform. The 'period_low' and 'period_high' arguments define the cutoff periods for filtering. The user can adopt one out of three types of windowning 'win': "gaussian", "cosine" or "none". Note that the method assumes that the data are evenly sampled. It computes the frequency resolution and the frequency vector using the sampling rate ('srate' in samples  per year) and the number of points in the FFT output.It then creates a frequency mask to isolate the desired frequency range ('fhigh' 
and 'flow'). Finally the inverse FFT is computed to obtain the filtered time series.
